## Introduction

Tini Studio, also known as Tiki IDE, is an integrated development environment for building mini programs on the Tini App platform. It consists of a project management tool, code editor, debugging tool, simulator and upload tool that allows uploading applications to the Dev Center.

## Project management

Tini Studio enables creating projects and managing files in the project, Git tools and npm packages.

## Code Editor

The editor is designed to boost coding productivity:

- Syntax highlighting: supports for Tini App frameworkâ€™s TXML/TCSS languages and JS API.  It improves the readability and comprehensibility of code.
- Autocomplete: the editor predicts the rest of a word and suggests the code syntax as the programmer is typing. It speeds up the process of coding.
- Linting: automatically scan code to detect syntax errors. 


### Development

Tini Studio provides tools to improve developer's coding experience:

- Code editor: Supports syntax highlight for TXML, TCSS and JS APIs.
- Autocomplete: Auto suggesting syntax and functions from TXML, TCSS and JS APIs.
- Linting: Quickly detect syntax and other errors while coding.

### Simulator

With the simulator, programmers can run their applications on the computer instead of on the mobile device. The simulator is characterized by:

- Live preview: Reflects real-time changes in code.
- Preset devices: Programmers can check the behaviors of their apps in common preset devices.
- Hardware simulation: Simulates the mobile device's functions such as location, camera and shaking 

### Debugging

Compiler Log and DevTools are two useful and comprehensive debugging tools.

- Simulator: Errors happen at runtime will be displayed right in the simulator.
- DevTools: Errors related to network, storage... can be checked with DevTools.
- Remote debugging: Run the app on a real device.
