---

## 1. Downloading Tini Studio

Tini Studio is available in Windows and MacOS. Visit the [link](https://developers.tiki.vn/downloads) to download the studio.

## 2. Installing Tini Studio

Run the Tini Studio installer and follow the installation wizard.

## 3. Creating a new project

1. Perform either of the following:
   - Way 1: Select **New Project** from the **File** menu.
   - Way 2: On the **Getting Started** page of Tini Studio, click **New Project**.
2. In the **Configure your project** dialogue, type the project name, App ID and the location where you want to store the project [in the **Save Location** box].
   - **App ID**: the unique identification of a Tini App. You register it while creating a new Tini App on the [Tini Console](https://developer.tiki.vn/apps). Refer to [Create your Tini App](/docs/introduce/create). So long as you are yet to create the app on the Tini Console, you can type any string that conforms to the format of the App ID in order to create the project first.

## 4. Coding the app

## 5. Running the app locally

To run a Tini App in Tini Studioâ€™s simulator on your computer, do as follows:

1. Compile the app by selecting Tools from the Compile menu.
    ***Note:*** Conventionally it is unnecessary to carry out such a step. Providing that there are any changes to the code, Tini Studio will automatically re-compile the project. 
2. Open the simulator through either of the following ways:
   - Way 1: Select **Simulator** from the **View** menu.
   - Way 2: Click the **Simulator** button below the main menu.

## 6. Debbuging

## 7. Uploading the app to the Tini Console

## 8. Running the app with Dev Assistant

Refer to [Dev Assistant](/docs/introduce/dev-assistant).
