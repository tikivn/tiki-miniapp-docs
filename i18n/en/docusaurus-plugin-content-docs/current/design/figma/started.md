If you are new to Figma I highly recommend visiting their [Getting Started help page](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002051613-Getting-Started) or watching [Beginner's Guide to Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2dkpBxst8&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4&ab_channel=Figma) on their YouTube channel.

### Components

Tini Design System is built with Components (Basic & Advance). These are elements you can reuse across your designs. They help to create and manage consistent designs across projects. Learn more about Components [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma).

### Styles

Tini Design System is also built with Styles. These are Colors, Text styles, Effects that can be reused across your designs. Learn more about Styles and how to use them [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238753-Styles-in-Figma).

### Auto layout

Components in the Tini Design System were built with Auto Layout feature. Auto Layout makes designs that grow to fill or shrink to fit, and reflow as their contents change. Learn more about Auto Layout [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-Auto-Layout).

### Variants

Tini Design System uses Variants that allow to group and organize similar components into a single container with properties. This simplifies the component library and makes it easier for everyone to find what they need. Learn more about Variants [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants).
