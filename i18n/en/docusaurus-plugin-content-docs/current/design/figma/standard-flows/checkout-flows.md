## Introduction

<img src="../../../../img/standard-flows/checkout-hero-header.png" width="640"/>

### Goals

Standardized third-party & first-party checkout experience. Three main product types that need to be covered


* Digital products (Traveloka - Airplane ticket, Miki, Hotel booking,..)
* Physical products (Tefal - Home kitchen, Gas24h, Gióng coffee,...)
* Food & Beverage (F&B) products (KFC - fried chicken, Thèm, Tasty kitchen,...)

Based on the three main product types, we can breakdown the checkout experience into 2 approaches:

* **Add-to-cart checkout**
* **Quick checkout**

|                   | ATC checkout | Quick checkout
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------
| Cart page    | Has separated cart page, includes selectable & editable (quantities, attributes) product item                    | Merge cart & checkout page
| Checkout page  | Order summary includes view-only product items               | Order summary includes editable (quantities, attributes) product items
| Product type     | Products that encourage users to browse & save in the cart for later purchases. Users buying decisions might need lots of reconsideration.  | Products that want a quick conversion from browsing to payment. Users buying decisions can be made quickly.
