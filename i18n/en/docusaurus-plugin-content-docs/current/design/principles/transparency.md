## Instant understanding

The first few seconds of entering a Tini App are the most important moment of us to help users understand its functionalities and how to interact with it, and each screen should have a clear presentation, using simple, easy-to-understand language, in order to avoid any potential confusion users of any ages and educational background might experience.

## Make navigation self-evident

Tini Apps are a new concept for Vietnamese users, they may not be familiar with the navigation. To help users have intuitively feel where they are in the workflow, the recommended maximum navigation depth is three levels. In case more than three levels, consider leveraging the bottom menu or progress bar to enable horizontal navigation between your sections.
