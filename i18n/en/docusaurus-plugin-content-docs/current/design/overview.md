Tiki (short for “Tìm kiếm & Tiết kiệm”, which means “Search & Save”) is Vietnam’s fastest and most trusted e-commerce platform. In an already fast-growing Vietnam e-commerce market, we are the first in the country to offer Tini Apps technology for partners. <br />
The Tini Apps design team builds a design system for the Tini Apps platform based on the Tiki design system with the name Tini. The Tini Design System will help product designers to uniform the user interfaces to focus on a better user experience, deliver ideas and products faster. <br />
