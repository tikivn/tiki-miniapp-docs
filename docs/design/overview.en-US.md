## **Introduction**

Tiki (short for “Tìm kiếm & Tiết kiệm”, which means “Search & Save”) is Vietnam’s fastest and most trusted B2C e-commerce platform. Tiki is Vietnam’s most trusted e-commerce platform. In an already fast-growing Vietnam e-commerce market, we are the first in the country to offer mini-app technology for partners. </br>
The Mini-app design team builds a design system for the Mini-app platform based on the Tiki design system with the name Tiny. The Tiny Design System will help product designers to uniform the user interfaces to focus on a better user experience, deliver ideas and products faster.
