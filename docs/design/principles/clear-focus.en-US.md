## Focus on task
As a general rule, try to stay away from anything that requires users to remember to go back to your mini app to complete tasks, they most likely wonâ€™t.

Once the user has entered a "complete-the-task" flow, help them finish the task within the shortest amount of time possible by removing other potential distractions on-screen. 

## Stay on the screen
Solve most of the problems on the same screen and avoid leading users to a new one if not necessary, because the page refresh and forwarding can make users feel uncertain about the next step, in addition to disrupting the user's mental flow.
