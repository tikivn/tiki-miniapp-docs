title: Distinguishable content hierarchy 
---
Each screen should design its primary and secondary hierarchy according to the importance of the content, clarify the key points, help users quickly get the information they need, and avoid distraction to the user's decision or operation on the screen.

## Information architecture
When designing each screen, we must ensure:
- The user can distinguish the primary and secondary content/ action in the screen.
- The hierarchy and level of information are clear.
- The level of information should not be too much.

## Clear action
The interface can help users quickly understand and avoid interference factors that have to distract the user's decision on the screen.
